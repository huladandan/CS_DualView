# CS_dual_view
Testing code for "Dual-view separation and reconstruction from one random compressed measurement".

To run the code, you should copy our "vl_simplenn.m" into the 'Matconvnet/matlab/simplenn' path.
If you want to test this code with Restormer, please download the file named 'gaussian_gray_denoising_blind.pth' from the following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rEAHUBkA9uCe9Q0AzI5zkYxePSgxYDEG. After downloading, place this file into the 'CS_dual_view/Trained_Weights/Restormer/pretrained_models' directory.
